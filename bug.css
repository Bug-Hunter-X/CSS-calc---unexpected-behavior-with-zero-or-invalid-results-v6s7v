The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but there's a lesser-known issue: if you try to use a calculation with a unit that results in a zero value, some browsers might not render the property correctly, or ignore it completely. For example, `width: calc(100% - 100%);` would ideally result in a width of 0, but some browsers may not render it correctly. Another scenario is dividing by zero, which results in an `Invalid Property Value` in some browsers, instead of expected `Infinity`.
